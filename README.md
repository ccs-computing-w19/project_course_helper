# project_course_helper

Spring Boot Webapp to help manage a project course.

Project courses such as CS56, CS48 and CCS CS1L often have multiple individuals or groups working on projects, each within a github repo, each with its own set of issues and a Kanban board.

Users of the application will include:
* Students in the course
* TA/Mentors
* Instructors

Users in each role will see a dashboard view appropriate to their role in the course, with the informatino they need to be successful.

This webapp is intended to work with the existing Github features, but provide a window into activities that is suitable for a university course.
